# Project:  Utilize SQL queries to find the most popular baby names in America in 100 years (1920-2020)


## 1. Objective

We'll be working with data provided by the United States Social Security Administration, which lists first names along with the number and sex of babies they were given to in each year. For processing speed purposes, we've limited the dataset to first names which were given to over 5,000 American babies in a given year. Our data spans 101 years, from 1920 through 2020.


## 2. Tools 

- SQL

## 3. Programming Report 
The code report (with full annotation) can be found in the notebook.ipynb file in the root directory of the project.
